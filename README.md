# Exercise 4

I've implemented some scenarios using cypress as test framework. Initially also wanted to integrate cucumber as well but there is a known issue for the preeprocessor I've installed taht was impeding me to run cypress in interactive mode (https://github.com/badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/issues/6). Nonetheless I did a bit of Page Object Model (you will fine the scenarios at cypress/e2e/features and the POM at cypress/e2e/pages)
