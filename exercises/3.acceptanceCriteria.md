I find the defined Acceptance Criteria to be incomplete. The Acceptance Criteria (AC) should be a collection of detailed conditions that a feature must meet to be considered as completed. The AC should outline the necessary steps to achieve the outcome defined in the user story, ensuring alignment with user expectations. 

One possible AC format would be defining scenarios to bring more technical details to the feature scope. The different scenarios described usually include the so called "Happy path" and "Rain" scenarios and are usually written using Gherkin format.

For instance, some possible scenarios for the first acceptance criteria would be:

Scenario 1: View data from a single selected employe 
    Given the Employee with name Andrew and lastname Fuller is selected from the list of employees
    When the user clicks the "View selected data" button
    Then the following list is printed:
        | Value                 |
        | Andrew is from Tacoma |

Scenario 2: Display "No city defined for employee <EmpLN>, <EmpFN>" when viewing data for employees with no city defined
    Given the Employee with name Anne and lastname Dodsworth is selected from the list of employees
    When the user clicks the "View selected data" button
    Then the following list is printed:
        | Value                                        |
        | No city defined for employee Dodsworth, Anne |

Scenario 3: View selected data for multiple employees at different tree levels
    Given the Employee with name Andrew and lastname Fuller is selected from the list of employees
    And the Employee with name Robert and lastname King is selected from the list of employees
    When the user clicks the "View selected data" button
    Then the following list is printed:
        | Value                      |
        | Andrew is from Tacoma      |
        | Robert King is from London |

Scenario 4: Message "Select at least one employee from the list" is displayed if view selected data is clicked while no employee is selected
    Given no Employee is selected from the list of employees
    When the user clicks the "View selected data" button
    Then the following list is printed:
        | Value                                           |
        | Select at least one employee from the list      |
